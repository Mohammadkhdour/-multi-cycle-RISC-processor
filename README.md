# üî• Multi-Cycle RISC Processor - Computer Architecture Project

## üìå Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **multi-cycle RISC processor**, integrating control logic, instruction memory, data memory, and functional units such as the **ALU, register file, multiplexers, and PC control unit**. The multi-cycle execution model ensures efficient instruction handling by breaking down execution into multiple stages: **Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write-Back**.

## üéØ Objectives
- ‚úÖ Design and implement a **multi-cycle RISC processor**.
- ‚úÖ Develop an **RTL architecture** using Verilog.
- ‚úÖ Simulate and test various instruction types (R-Type, I-Type, J-Type, Load/Store operations).
- ‚úÖ Verify the processor‚Äôs functionality through waveform analysis.
- ‚úÖ Optimize performance by structuring execution across multiple cycles.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Components

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Instruction Memory**
- Stores the instructions to be executed by the processor.
- Fetches instructions in multiple cycles to allow sequential execution.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Register File**
- Contains small, high-speed storage locations (registers) accessible by the processor.
- Supports register-based operations to enhance execution speed.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**
- Performs arithmetic and logical operations (e.g., ADD, SUB, AND, OR).
- Used during the **execution phase** of the pipeline.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Memory**
- Stores and retrieves data required by load and store instructions.
- Handles memory access stages within the processor cycle.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplexers & Sign Extenders**
- Direct control signals within the processor to select appropriate data paths.
- Sign extenders extend smaller bit-width values for proper execution.

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ PC (Program Counter) Control**
- Manages instruction sequencing and branching logic.
- Updates the program counter based on instruction execution results.

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Main Control Unit**
- Generates control signals to regulate data flow and execution sequencing.
- Ensures proper coordination between different processor components.

## üöÄ Instruction Set & RTL Design
The processor supports multiple instruction types categorized as:

### ‚úÖ **R-Type Instructions** (Arithmetic & Logical)
- ADD, SUB, AND, OR
- Uses register-based operands and ALU computations.

### ‚úÖ **I-Type Instructions** (Immediate & Memory Operations)
- ADDI, ANDI, LW, SW, LBs, LBu
- Supports immediate values and memory interactions.

### ‚úÖ **J-Type Instructions** (Jump & Branching)
- JMP, CALL, RET
- Alters the program counter for function calls and returns.

### ‚úÖ **Branching Instructions**
- BEQ, BEQZ, BNE, BNEZ, BGT, BGTZ, BLT, BLTZ
- Implements conditional execution based on comparisons.
